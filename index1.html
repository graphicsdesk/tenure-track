Faye McNeill gained tenure in 2014, she was the first woman in the chemical engineering department to do so. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “As I was coming up through the tenure track, there was always either one or zero other women in my department,” she said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Over seven years after McNeill received tenure, women make up just 16.9 percent of tenured engineering professors, and Black, Latinx, Native American, or Pacific Islander scholars make up 4.5 percent. Many professors feel that the lack of diversity within tenured faculty means that the system negatively impacts the work environment in their respective departments and weakens Columbia as an academic institution. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Across the University, women make up 29.6 percent of tenured professors, and underrepresented minorities make up just 7.5 percent. By contrast, women make up 54 percent of professors ineligible for tenure, while “underrepresented minorities” make up 11.6 percent. This follows a broader trend of diverse faculty representation remaining contained to<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/08/22/study-finds-gains-faculty-diversity-not-tenure-track"> the adjunct level</a>. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> TENURE BY GENDER GRAPHIC </p> <div class="graphic"> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> O’Flaherty said that a fear of not gaining tenure might drive professors to leave the University. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “People don’t go up for tenure unless it’s pretty clear that they’ll get it,” he said. “People will look elsewhere when they think they’re not going to continue.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Mincy noted that the process can be particularly difficult for scholars of color who may come out of graduate school without strong mentorship and guidance on how to be competitive candidates for tenure. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “There isn’t necessarily a sense of direction about where they should go and how they should go,” he said. “Most underrepresented scholars … do not know what the rules are.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Professors seeking tenure at Columbia first go up for one, three, five, and seven-year reviews by their departments. In the arts and sciences, candidates are then reviewed by the Promotion and Tenure Committee, followed by the Tenure Review Advisory Committee.<b> </b>Finally, tenure candidates must be approved by the Board of Trustees. Throughout the process, the candidates are reviewed based on three criteria: research, teaching, and service. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Sociology professor Gil Eyal, a member of TRAC, noted that diversity is not a direct consideration in the tenure process. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “That is not the main way in which the University seeks to diversify its faculty,” he said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Eyal said that the strict standards for receiving tenure at Columbia might complicate bringing diverse faculty to the tenure track. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “The tenure process at Columbia is more stringent and harder than at a lot of other schools,” he said. “[This] creates an obstacle when trying to attract top candidates, top minority candidates. ... You have goals of excellence and you have goals of diversification. It’s not the case that you’re completely precluding the other goal, … but there is a balance here. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The University maintains that “[u]nderrepresented faculty at Columbia are no less likely to obtain tenure than their colleagues.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Columbia is dedicated to supporting all faculty, particular historically underrepresented faculty, through faculty orientation, robust professional development offerings, junior and mid career faculty grants, and consistent efforts to enhance the climate of inclusiveness across the University,” Dennis Mitchell, senior vice provost for faculty advancement, wrote in a statement to Spectator. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In an anonymous survey conducted by the Policy Planning Committee in 2018, professors from underrepresented minorities reported feeling that the difficulty of gaining tenure at Columbia required them to make “extra water-tight cases.” The report also displayed disparities in the proportion of underrepresented faculty who are denied or not put up for tenure. 62 percent of underrepresented faculty did not receive tenure or were not put up for tenure, compared to 50 percent of white candidates and 47 percent of Asian candidates. The report found that this disparity was particularly pronounced among Black and Hispanic faculty members. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> FACULTY TENURE BY RACE AND CITIZENSHIP GRAPHIC </p> <div class="graphic"> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Piccato, who serves on the Policy Planning Committee, affirmed that professors of color reported feeling more responsibility to “get tenure, … do all of the things that you have to do to get tenure, but also to serve as mentors, advisors, and role models for the students.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Piccato noted that ending this disparity ought to remain an administrative priority. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Obviously, it’s not a process that you can change easily, because it’s established,” he said. “But at least to be mindful that there could be some challenges that need to be addressed, that’s an important consideration.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Helping junior faculty understand how to make a successful case for tenure could help diversify the body of tenured faculty, Mincy said. He said the School of Social Work has made its requirements for tenure clearer since he entered the school in 2001, which has aided the process in becoming more equitable and accessible. Now, he said, we must continue asking, “How do underrepresented scholars become aware of the rules of the game?” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Read on to find out more about how women professors and professors of color build their legacies at the University. </i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Staff writer Talia Traskos-Hart can be contacted at </i><i>talia.traskos-hart@columbiaspectator.com</i><i>.
